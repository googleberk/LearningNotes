1. The first approach is to **define probability** in terms of frequency of occurrence, as a percentage of successes in a moderately large number of similar situations. However, this might be **wrong**, What if this was an experimental drug that was administered for the very first time in this hospital or in the nurse's experience? (如果是**第一次**的话有可能并不知道之前的实验的结果/概率，所以没办法判断)

    1.1 another interpretation of probability is an expression of a subjective belief.

2. ??? find the definition of countably infinite.

    2.1: Similarly, the set of all scalars x in the interval [0, 1] can be writeen as {x | 0 <= x <=1 } Note that the elements x of the latter set take a **continuous range of values**, and **cannot be written down in a list**; such a set is said to be **uncountable**.

3. Two sets are said to be **disjoint** if their intersection is empty. 
   More generally, several sets are said to be **disjoint** if no two of them have a common element. (for example: if there are n sets, them these n sets are disjoint if for 1 <= i,j <= n, i != j, Seti intersect Setj = 0)
   A collection of sets is said to be a **partition** of a set S if the sets in the collection are disjoint and their union is S.
