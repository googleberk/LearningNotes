1. Inserting elements on average take constant time for both data structures(hash table; a linked list), and may take longer in a hash table if there have been a lot of collisions in the hash set. [Hashing](https://www.hackerearth.com/zh/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/)

    1.1: [testing for the membership of an element in the data structure] O(1) - First, the element is hashed, then the bucket corresponding to the hash value is checked, On average, this takes constant time. Note that "on average" assumes that the hash function is good and there are not lots of collisions which would cause the hash set to iterate over all items in a bucket.
    1.2: [testing for the membership of an element in the data structure] O(n) - You have no guarantee of where anything is in the list, meaning there is no way to narrow down the search. **On average** this results in having to inspect **half the elements**(**actually n/2**) in the list whenever the element is in the list and all elements when it is not in the list.
