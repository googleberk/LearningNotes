1. **Group Theory** way of thinking why [e^(i*pai) equals -1].

    In the complex plain, in the additive group representation, e ^ **[x]** can be thought of as stretching the complex axis(y axis) by **[x]** unit. And this is an exact match with respect to the multiplicative group representation of the complex plain, by rotating (1, 0) by exactly **[x]** unit.
    So, in general, e ^ (pai * i) = -1 (rotate from (1, 0) to (-1, 0) by (pai * i) unit of).
